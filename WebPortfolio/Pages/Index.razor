    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        I am a highly motivated and professional developer with many years experience in software development across a number of languages, including C#, C++ and Javascript.
        I am passionate about writing SOLID, testable code and enabling others to do the same.

        I have a lot of experience working in Agile teams and helping teams transition from waterfall to Agile.

    <h3>Passions</h3>
    <p>
        I am passionate about writing testable code. If you aren't writing testable code in the modern languages then I want to help you change.
        The tools available to today's developers mean testing your code and keeping the feedback loop small is easier than ever. But it can still be difficult to write code in a way to make it testable as most developers (and their managers) just want to write code that works, with only lip service to the technical debt that builds up.

        I am an advocate of Agile techniques and principles to help improve software delivery and user feedback loops. I have worked in a number of teams that have transitioned to using Agile principles in their development lifecycle
        and enjoy sharing that experience to help new teams make that move.
